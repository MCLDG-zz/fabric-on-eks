# Creating an EKS cluster

You have a number of options when creating the Kubernetes cluster in which you'll deploy Hyperledger Fabric:
 
* The easiest option is to use eksctl to create an AWS EKS (Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes) cluster
* You can use KOPS to create a cluster: https://github.com/kubernetes/kops
* Or you can use an existing Kubernetes cluster, as long as you can SSH into the worker nodes

Whichever method you choose, you will need SSH access to the Kubernetes worker nodes in order to install EFS utils. 
EFS utils is used to mount the EFS (Elastic File System) used to store the Hyperledger Fabric CA certs/keys. 
Instructions on how to do this are in the section 'Install EFS utils on each Kubernetes worker node' below.

This README will focus on creating an EKS cluster using eksctl.

## Creating an EKS cluster

There are two methods you can use to create an EKS cluster. You can:
 
* create the cluster from your own laptop
* create a Cloud9 environment, and create the cluster from Cloud9

I suggest you create the cluster from your laptop if you are using a Mac (since the eksctl instructions are Mac-based), 
and use Cloud9 if you have a Windows laptop.

## Creating an EKS cluster using Cloud9

To create an EKS cluster using Cloud9, follow the instructions 
[here](https://github.com/pahud/amazon-eks-workshop/blob/master/00-getting-started/create-eks-with-eksctl.md). 
HOWEVER, when you get to Step 11, do the following:

* Create a keypair, using the details in the section below titled 'Creating a keypair'
* Use this statement to create the EKS cluster instead of the one in Step 11:

```bash
eksctl create cluster --ssh-public-key <YOUR AWS KEYPAIR> --name eks-fabric --region us-west-2 --kubeconfig=./kubeconfig.eks-fabric.yaml
```

Note that `ssh-public-key` is the name of your public key (i.e. the value you passed to `aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name <KEYNAME>`), 
not the path to the .pem file you saved.

Now go an get a cup of coffee. It will take around 10-25 minutes to create the EKS cluster.

Once the cluster is created, follow the instructions in the section 'Install EFS utils on each Kubernetes worker node' below.

## Creating an EKS cluster using your Mac

The instructions below are similar to those on the eksctl website, with additional enhancements to the 'create cluster' 
command.

To download the latest release, run:

```bash
curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/download/latest_release/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin
```

Alternatively, macOS users can use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install weaveworks/tap/eksctl
```

You will need to have AWS API credentials configured. What works for AWS CLI or any other tools (kops, Terraform etc), should be 
sufficient. You can use [~/.aws/credentials file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-config-files.html) 
or [environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-environment.html). For more information 
read the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-environment.html).

Create a keypair, then create the EKS cluster:

* Create a keypair, using the details in the section below titled 'Creating a keypair'
* Use this statement to create the EKS cluster instead of the one in Step 11:

```bash
eksctl create cluster --ssh-public-key <YOUR AWS KEYPAIR> --name eks-fabric --region us-west-2 --kubeconfig=./kubeconfig.eks-fabric.yaml
```

Note that `ssh-public-key` is the name of your public key (i.e. the value you passed to `aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name <KEYNAME>`), 
not the path to the .pem file you saved.

Now go an get a cup of coffee. It will take around 10-25 minutes to create the EKS cluster. You should see something like this.

```bash
$ eksctl create cluster --ssh-public-key eksctl --name eks-fabric --region us-west-2 --kubeconfig=./kubeconfig.eks-fabric.yaml --profile account2

```

Now check whether `kubectl` can access your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
$ kubectl --kubeconfig=./kubeconfig.eks-fabric.yaml get nodes
NAME                                            STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
ip-192-168-113-140.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready     <none>    2m        v1.10.3
ip-192-168-163-2.us-west-2.compute.internal     Ready     <none>    2m        v1.10.3
```

Once the cluster is created, follow the instructions in the section 'Install EFS utils on each Kubernetes worker node' below.

## Creating a keypair

You will need a keypair in the same region as you create the EKS cluster. We default this to us-west-2, so create a
keypair in us-west-2 and make sure you download the keypair to either your laptop or your Cloud9 environment, depending
on which method you will use to create your EKS cluster.

Make sure your AWS CLI is pointing to the right account and region.

See [Using Key Pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-ec2-keypairs.html) in the AWS documentation
for details on how to use the command line to create and download a keypair.

Make sure you following the instructions to `chmod 400` your key.

## Install EFS utils on each Kubernetes worker node 
EFS utils is required on each Kubernetes worker node to enable the worker to mount the EFS used to store the Hyperledger 
Fabric CA certs/keys.

Before we can SSH into the Kubernetes worker nodes, we need to update the security group to allow SSH ingress.

You can do this from the console following the instructions here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/authorizing-access-to-an-instance.html#add-rule-authorize-access

The EC2 instances should be easy to identify in the console as the instance name is prefixed with your EKS cluster name, e.g.
eks-fabric-default-Node. Clicking on each instance will show you the security group and the public DNS, which you'll need
when you SSH into the instance.

Now SSH into each worker node and install the EFS utils, using the keypair you created earlier, as follows:

```bash
ssh ec2-user@ec2-54-244-69-254.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com -i eks/eksctl-keypair.pem
```

After SSH'ing into the worker node, run:

```bash
sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
```

Type `exit` to exit the EC2 instance. Install the EFS utils on all your EKS worker nodes. If you following the 
instructions here you should have 2 nodes.
